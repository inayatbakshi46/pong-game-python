# Pong Game

This is my second project in python using turtle graphics. It uses Turtle Graphics, OOP etc. To play this game just run the main.py file and you are good to go. For Player on the left side use W to move the paddle up and S to move the paddle down and for the Player on the right side use ARROW UP key to move it up and ARROW DOWN key to move it down.
